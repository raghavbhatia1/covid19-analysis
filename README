# COVID-19 and Happiness Data Analysis

This project is part of Module 12. The goal is to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 confirmed cases and happiness indicators like GDP, social support, and life expectancy.

## Datasets Used
-COVID-19 Dataset: Daily confirmed cases by country (2020)
-Happiness Dataset: Includes happiness score, GDP, social support, health, freedom, etc.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Steps Followed
1. Loaded both datasets using pandas.
2. Cleaned the data and grouped COVID-19 cases by country.
3. Merged both datasets using the country name.
4. Visualized top affected countries, correlations, and scatter plots.
5. Analyzed trends and wrote key insights.

## Key Findings
- No strong correlation between happiness and COVID-19 outcomes.
- High GDP or social support does not guarantee fewer cases.
- Other factors (like population, policies) may influence the results.
